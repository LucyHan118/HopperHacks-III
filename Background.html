	<h1>History Of Plastic</h1>
	<body style="text-align:center;">
		<h2>
		Plastic was first invented in 1869 by John Wesley Hyatt, and was first mass produced 
		by Leo Baekeland in 1907 to save nature materials. For the first time human 
		manufacturing was not constrained by the limits of nature. The creation of new 
		materials also helped free people from the social and economic constraints imposed 
		by the scarcity of natural resources. Inexpensive celluloid made material wealth 
		more widespread and obtainable. However, things took a twist down the road, 
		beginning in the 1960s, which is a decade in which Americans became increasingly 
		aware of environmental problems, and the environment became heavily polluted by 
		plastic materials.
